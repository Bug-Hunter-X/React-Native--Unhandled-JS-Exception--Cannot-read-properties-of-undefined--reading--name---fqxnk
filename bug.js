This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in JavaScript, but it can be especially tricky to debug in React Native because the error messages can be unhelpful. 

For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch user data
    fetchUserData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text>  {/* Error here if user is null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

If the `fetchUserData` function hasn't completed yet, `user` will be `null`, causing a runtime error when the app tries to access `user.name`.  The error message may not clearly indicate the root cause, often pointing only to the line where the property access occurs.
